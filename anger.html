<div>
    where anger came from?
    It's the sequel of pride.
    in the moment we think we deserve something, because we actually 'something', and we didn't get it than we get
    mad-angry and blame the other on things that are not lake but from our certain perspective.
    pride - the term hve a lot of levels but all came from the thought 'I am' when there is no I but we, we are a
    collective and the more we practice it(by mercie and grace) the more it's easier to overcame the pride.
